                <p class="marketing-site-content-section-block-subheader subheader">
                    Kerry Fitzgerald came into this world with a bang! It was her mother's 26th birthday when she felt her first pains of labor.
                    1.5 hours later, Kerry entered the world bright eyes and lungs blaring.
                    The second daughter to Rich "Fitz" and MaryEllen, she was greeted at home by her older sister, Megan, and the family's German Shepard, Madchen.
                    Her family lived in very strong Irish Catholic community of the south side of Chicago (where they still reside to this day).
                    <br><br>
                    Growing up, Kerry was the fourth oldest of 32 children all living on 1 city block.
                    Within the neighborhood, it was as if time had stood still in the middle of the 1950's:
                    Most of the families in her neighborhood adhered to the stereotypical mother-father household.
                    Even more so, most of the men worked 9am-5pm and the women stayed home with the children. 
                    Wherever you were at dinner time, you were fed. Wherever you were for bath time, you got bathed. 
                    The sense of security and community that these early years impressed upon Kerry followed her through her
                    schooling and into her career.

            <h3 class="marketing-site-content-section-block-header">The School Years</h3>
                <p class="marketing-site-content-section-block-subheader subheader">
                    Being that she was an Irish Catholic girl living on the south side of Chicago, it was only natural for Kerry to attend college at
                    The University of Illinois, Champaign/Urbana. It was her that she honed her desire to work with child (and her drinking skills)
                    through classes in education and psychology. She waited until the absolute last moment, when she was told she could no long enroll in classes
                    as an undeclared major, to finally decided on psychology as her major.  Declaring psychology as her major really solidified some things 
                    in Kerry's life...like the need to go on to graduate school.
                    <br><br>
                    After searching for programs where she didn't need to take any further testing to be accepted, she found a few worthy contentors.
                    But none compared to Erikson Institute. Not only was it in her home town of Chicago, but it was a world reknowned school for child development
                    and early childhood education. She went straight from her studies at the U of I to Erikson, with about 2 weeks in between the two!
                    Kerry fell in love not only with the cirriculum at Erikson, but the people, both in the seats next her and at the podiums in front of her.

                            After grad school, Kerry began working as a licensed Developmental Therapist with Early Intervention.
                            Early Intervention is a federally funded program for children aged in utero through three years who are 
                            either identified as at risk or high need based on a developmental delay of 20% or more in any area of development.
                            She worked predominately with the Spanish-speaking immigrant population on the south side of Chicago. Though the neighborhoods
                            she was going into had a reputation of being rough and gang infested (she had heard gunshots close by numerous times while out working), she found her
                            time within these communities to be some of the best working years of her life.
                            <br><br>
                            While a true Chicago girl through and through, Kerry began to feel nature, and the mountains, calling her name. In 2013 she decided to 
                            pack up shop and move half way across the country with her cat and dog in tow. The 18 hour drive while towing a heavy trailer wasn't 
                            easy on any of them, but once they settled in, it seemed to be the best decision for them all. In Denver, Kerry worked as a Mental Health
                            and Disabilities Coordinator at a Head Start/Early Head Start Montessori program with two locations; one in the Highland and 
                            the other in Five Points. She took the job for the title, but fell in love with the Head Start/Early Head Start program. She worked
                            here for 2 years before moving on to create an early childhood development consultation program for children and families in Denver and the front range.

                            Kerry was working on creating a website and blog for her consultation business when the coding bug bit her. She found 
                            basic coding to be intriguing and the idea of combining her background in child development with coding to be exciting.
                            It just so happened that at this moment, a friend of hers has found a coding bootcamp offered through the technical
                            college and a tech company in Denver. He told her about the class and suggested that she look into it further. She did. And she found
                            out that the course was in her price range as well: free.
                            <br><br>
                            She started taking classes focusing on python, html, css, and js in March of 2018. It has been a fast-paced
                            program with the students using their time at home to teach themselves concepts before solidifying them in 
                            class. And Kerry has loved every minute of it! She is excited to continue working on her projects in the bootcamp and looks forward
                            to seeing what the next section of the prgram has in store for her. While she isn't clear what the future may hold for her in coding, 
                            she has recently accepted a small, part time position as an IT consultant for a Denver based company. While she has noted that she may be
                            a bit over her head in this most recent endeavor, she can't wait to see what she will make of it!
